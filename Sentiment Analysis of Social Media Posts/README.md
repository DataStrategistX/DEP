This project focuses on determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of social media posts regarding a specific product or brand. 
By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, particularly BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), 
we aim to gauge public opinion and sentiment trends. 
The dataset includes columns such as target, ids, date, flag, user, and text, which provide comprehensive details for each social media post.

The workflow involves several key steps: collecting data, preprocessing the text to clean and tokenize it,
applying sentiment analysis using BERT, and visualizing sentiment trends. The preprocessing includes lowering text case,
removing URLs and punctuation, and tokenizing the text. BERT's sentiment analysis pipeline then classifies each cleaned text into positive, 
negative, or neutral sentiments. Finally, we visualize the sentiment distribution to understand public opinion better. 
This project provides valuable insights into the overall sentiment towards the product or brand, aiding in strategic decision-making.
