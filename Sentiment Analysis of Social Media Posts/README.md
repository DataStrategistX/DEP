This project focuses on determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of social media posts regarding a specific product 
or brand using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner). 
The dataset includes columns such as target, ids, date, flag, user, and text, providing comprehensive details for each social media post.

The workflow involves several key steps: collecting data, preprocessing the text to clean and tokenize it, applying sentiment analysis using VADER, and visualizing sentiment trends. Preprocessing includes lowering the text case, removing URLs and punctuation, and tokenizing the text. VADER's sentiment analysis then classifies each cleaned text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Finally, sentiment distribution visualization aids in understanding public opinion better. 
This project provides valuable insights into the overall sentiment towards the product or brand, assisting in strategic decision-making.
