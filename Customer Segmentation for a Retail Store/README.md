This project focuses on customer segmentation for a retail store using data science techniques. 
By analyzing the purchasing behavior of customers, the goal is to identify distinct customer groups that share similar characteristics and purchasing habits.
This segmentation allows the retail store to tailor its marketing strategies and improve customer engagement,
ultimately driving sales and customer satisfaction.

Our model has effectively segmented customers into three distinct groups, each with specific characteristics:

Cluster Id 0: This group consists of customers who buy infrequently, spend little, and have not made recent purchases.
As a result, they are the least valuable to the business.
Cluster Id 1: Customers in this cluster have average scores for recency, frequency, and monetary expenditure. 
They represent a middle-ground group in terms of engagement and spending.
Cluster Id 2: This cluster includes the most engaged customers who make frequent purchases, 
spend a lot, and have recently placed orders. They are considered the most valuable to the business.
