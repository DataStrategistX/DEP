This project of data science is about creating a real estate Predicting House Prices model.
We'll start by developing a model using scikit-learn and linear regression, with a dataset of Bangalore home prices from Kaggle. 
Throughout the model development, we'll explore key data science concepts such as data loading and cleaning, outlier handling, 
feature engineering, Model selection and training, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, and k-fold cross-validation.
The project will utilize:
Python Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning 
Matplotlib for data visualization 
Scikit-learn for model building
