This project aims to detect anomalies in network traffic to identify potential security breaches. 
By analyzing network traffic data, we can uncover patterns and detect unusual activities that may signify cyber threats. 
The dataset contains various features such as packet sizes, time intervals, source and destination IP addresses, and protocol types,
which are crucial for effective anomaly detection.

The key steps in this project include data collection and preprocessing, feature extraction, 
application of anomaly detection algorithms, and evaluation and validation of the detected anomalies. Initially, 
the data is loaded and cleaned to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
Essential features like packet sizes and time intervals between packets are extracted and prepared for analysis. 
The Isolation Forest algorithm is then applied to detect anomalies in the network traffic, 
identifying instances that deviate significantly from normal patterns.

To evaluate and validate the results, visualizations such as scatter plots are used to highlight anomalies in the context of the selected features. 
Statistical analysis further compares the properties of anomalous and normal data, ensuring the robustness of the anomaly detection process. 
This project provides a comprehensive approach to identifying potential security threats in network traffic,
leveraging advanced machine learning techniques for effective anomaly detection.
